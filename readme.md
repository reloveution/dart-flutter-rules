The original set of rules has been collected since July 20025 and is available in the branch https://github.com/reloveution/dart-flutter-rules/tree/03-11-25-edits.

Then, the official rules from the Dart/Flutter team were integrated https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/ai-rules.

After that, some points from the beautiful rules by Evanca were integrated https://github.com/evanca/flutter-ai-rules. *Everything related to Firebase and the moctail package has been integrated without changes - completely, and will be edited in the next iterations.
