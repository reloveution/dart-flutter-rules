# Code Review

## Mindset

- No assumptions — investigate implementation details before judging correctness
- Be objective; devil's advocate approach, not automatic praise
- Fetch documentation when unsure about package best practices
- If a change remains unclear after investigation, flag it in the report

## Pre-Review

- Branch is feature/bugfix — not main/develop
- Branch is up-to-date with target (main)
- List all changed/added/deleted files
- For every change: review commit title and connected components

## Per File

- Correct directory and naming conventions
- Clear single responsibility; reason for change is understandable
- Readable names; correct logic; no missing edge cases
- Modular, no unnecessary duplication
- Errors/exceptions handled; no security concerns (input validation, no secrets)
- No obvious performance issues
- Public APIs and complex logic documented
- Sufficient test coverage for new/changed logic
- Matches project style guide
- Generated files up-to-date and not manually edited

## PR-Level

- Change set focused and scoped to stated purpose
- PR description accurately reflects changes
- Tests cover new/changed logic; evaluate if tests can actually fail (not just mock checks)
- CI passes

## Output

Conclusions and recommendations per file. Constructive feedback with suggestions.
